        “And Still, I Love You”
(Written at 4 a.m., when the world sleeps but my heart doesn’t.)
It began beneath the rustle of morning prayers,
rows of uniforms swaying in rhythm,
the school courtyard still tasting of chalk and sun.
And somewhere among a hundred faces,
my eyes stopped moving.
She was just there —
unaware, glowing softly in the golden air,
and for a heartbeat, time simply forgot to breathe.
I don’t remember the song we sang,
or the teacher’s call,
only the way my world quietly shifted toward her.
I was too young to name it,
but even then, it felt like forever had blinked.
A year later, fate shuffled desks and hearts.
Her name appeared beside mine on the attendance sheet —
and suddenly, school was something sacred.
I’d look her way, pretending to fix a pen,
pretending not to care,
but every glance was a prayer I never learned to end.
Her laughter made the air lighter,
and my silence heavier.
I was shy, afraid of my own heartbeat,
afraid that if I spoke,
the whole dream would vanish into the noise.
So I lived that year
as the boy who watched her smile
and told no one why his own wouldn’t fade.
Years turned and with them, courage and fear grew side by side.
By class seven, I had promised myself
I’d finally tell her —
that she was the reason my world still sparkled
in the dullness of everyday lessons.
But before I could,
the universe decided to test how much I could break quietly.
She liked someone else.
And I stood there,
watching a story I wanted to live
be written for another.
I smiled through it, of course,
the way boys do when their heart cracks
but their pride stays standing.
After that, I made distance my new companion,
learned to hide behind studies,
to stare at the ceiling instead of her face,
to feel everything and show nothing.
That year taught me
that silence can hurt louder than words.
Then came the pandemic —
the strange, still year when the world stayed home
and screens became our only window to life.
But for me, the world shrank
into a tiny rectangle on my monitor —
a video frame that carried her smile.
Online classes began,
and I pinned her video,
as if my Wi-Fi existed just for her pixels.
The teacher’s voice became distant thunder,
her “present, ma’am” my only melody.
Sometimes she’d laugh,
sometimes she’d adjust her hair,
and I’d sit there pretending to take notes,
while my heart learned new ways to stare.
Even through the grainy screen,
she made the loneliness bearable.
That little square of light
was enough to keep me alive through the dark.
When classes returned,
so did life,
and she — brighter, older,
yet still the same reason I’d forget my name.
One message on WhatsApp,
one tiny conversation,
and it was enough to turn my week into fireworks.
It wasn’t much, but it was something —
a whisper from the universe saying,
“Don’t give up yet.”
And I didn’t.
Then came the day everything changed.
Sections were announced for the next three years,
and for once, luck leaned my way.
We’d be together again —
same halls, same laughter, same chance.
I can still feel that surge in my chest —
the happiness that didn’t need explaining.
When school reopened fully,
I saw her again, real and close.
And somehow, slowly,
our story began to write itself.
From classmates to friends,
from friends to best friends,
from best friends to something that felt
too warm to name.
We fell, gently,
the way two stars might forget the sky for each other.
And then,
on that unforgettable day —
21 October 2022 —
we both confessed.
No script, no grand plan,
just two hearts finally catching up
to what they already knew.
It was everything I had ever imagined
and nothing like I expected —
simple, trembling, perfect.
Those months were a dream stitched into reality.
The awkward brushes of hands,
the nervous laughter,
the shy kiss that felt like the world paused to watch.
From back-hooking her bag to resting her head on my shoulder,
we built a tiny world that felt endless.
Every small fight became poetry,
every reunion a celebration.
And when my birthday arrived,
she hugged me from behind —
tight, unplanned,
and suddenly I understood
why people call certain moments “forever.”
Time moved again — exams, pressure, growing up —
but we held on.
We studied side by side,
talked across screens,
laughed even when life tried to pull us apart.
There were jealous jokes —
that cute Bengali invigilator she teased me about —
and there were long nights
when only her voice could calm my chaos.
Then came the day we slipped out
after the chemistry lab practical,
our first real date.
A tiny restaurant, the smell of spice and rain.
She ordered her favourites;
I ordered her smile.
Outside, the clouds joined in —
pouring just as she left,
as if the sky itself didn’t want her to go.
People said teenage love doesn’t last,
but ours kept learning how to survive.
There were picnics and photos,
mehendi patterns on her palms pressed against mine,
frames and gifts,
laughter that still echoes across my room.
That photo frame she gave me —
it stands on my desk in Jaipur now,
a piece of home that travelled with me.
We grew together,
made promises we didn’t know how to keep
but meant every word of.
The next year came with lessons that weren’t from books.
We had dreams to chase —
her boards, my engineering hopes.
She studied late;
I coded and counted the hours to her next message.
Maybe my results didn’t shine,
but she was always my brightest mark.
We still stole time —
like that March afternoon at Moni Bhog,
when I ate before the photo,
she got adorably mad,
and I laughed till my sides hurt.
Those moments —
they built us more than any grand declaration.
Then the storm:
June, stubbornness, distance.
I hurt her, more than I meant to.
We almost fell apart.
But love, real love,
always knows how to find its way back.
When Durga Puja arrived,
we met secretly again —
the crowd buzzing,
our hearts louder.
That small stolen outing
felt like the universe had forgiven us.
And then life grew serious.
Boards, results, decisions —
and then, the biggest change of all.
I packed my bags for Jaipur.
She stayed in Kolkata.
Two cities, one heartbeat cut in half.
The train pulled away,
and I watched her vanish into the blur,
carrying all the noise and silence of our years.
Now I’m here —
 Jaipur —
surrounded by new faces, new air,
but somehow every sunset still glows her colour.
We talk when we can,
laugh when we must,
and pretend that thousands of kilometres
aren’t between us.
On a quiet July evening in 2025,
her mother called me over.
I went.
We got three hours alone in her room —
no drama, no rush,
just silence, smiles,
and that familiar comfort of being beside her.
I didn’t want to move.
The clock did, anyway.
When I left,
she smiled like she always does
— brave, bright, breaking inside —
and I carried that look back across states.
Later she said she needed distance,
to find peace,
and I said I’d wait.
Because love doesn’t end;
it only changes its shape.
And now here I am,
sitting under a tired hostel fan,
Jaipur moonlight spilling over the desk,
the city quiet except for the hum of my heart.
It’s 4 a.m. —
the hour when dreams blur with memory.
I should be asleep,
but instead I’m writing this —
our story, again,
hoping words can hold what distance cannot.
Maybe she’s asleep in Kolkata,
wrapped in her blanket of stars,
and maybe some part of her knows
that someone hundreds of miles away
is still wide awake for her.
I laugh remembering our silly fights,
the way she rolled her eyes,
how she’d say “you’re impossible”
and still stay.
I miss her voice,
the sound of her saying my name
like it was both scolding and love.
I’d trade every mark, every code, every lecture
just to hear that again.
Durga Puja came once more,
and somehow,
as if the gods themselves were rooting for us,
we met again —
secretly, softly, sweetly.
Back seats, laughter, mischief,
hands finding hands without needing permission.
And I thought,
this is what forever looks like —
not fireworks,
but two people smiling in the dark,
choosing each other despite everything.
So I sit here now,
half-awake, fully in love,
typing the story of my life into words
that will never be enough.
Maybe tomorrow I’ll wake,
attend class,
pretend to care about algorithms,
but part of me will still be standing
in that school courtyard,
watching her during morning prayer,
forgetting the lyrics
because love had already begun singing its own.
If she ever reads this,
I hope she smiles —
the same smile that began all this.
Because through all the years,
the laughter, the tears, the distance —
I never stopped being that boy
whose eyes got stuck at her beauty
and never found their way back.
It’s still 4 a.m.,
and I’m still hopelessly awake.
But I wouldn’t trade this sleeplessness for anything —
because loving her,
missing her,
remembering her —
has always been the sweetest dream
I never wanted to wake from.

    <h3>A Symphony of Apology from My Falling Heart</h3>
    <h4>This letter is filled with sincere emotions and a cascade of falling hearts, symbolizing my heartfelt apology.
    </h4>



    <p>Dear Tanisha (few lines),</p>

    <p>As I pen down these words, I find myself immersed in a sea of emotions, navigating the currents of our shared
      journey. Each stroke of the pen feels like a brush on the canvas of our story, painting a vivid picture of love,
      growth, and understanding.</p>

    <p>From the moment our paths first crossed to the challenges we faced and overcame, every chapter of our journey has
      etched itself into the tapestry of our shared existence. The laughter, the tears, the quiet moments — they all
      contribute to the symphony of our connection.</p>

    <p>Your presence in my life is like a gentle breeze, comforting and invigorating. Through the highs and lows, your
      unwavering support has been my anchor, grounding me in the warmth of our shared love.</p>

    <p>As we traverse the uncharted territories of life, I want you to know the profound impact you've had on my soul.
      Your essence is woven into the very fabric of who I am, and I am endlessly grateful for the depth of our
      connection.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my confidant, my partner, and my greatest source of joy. With each passing day, my love for
      you deepens, and I look forward to the countless moments we have yet to create together.</p>

    <p>Forever yours,</p>
    <p>Your Ribhu</p>
